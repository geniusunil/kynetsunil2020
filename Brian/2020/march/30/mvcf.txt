&nbsp;

<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find a lot of church website hosting out there. Most of them are good, but as a consumer, you should always look for the best. Also, church websites have a unique presence on the internet. As they are religious, the hosting also needs to be unique regarding features and performance. Not only it has to make sure that old visitors are keeping coming, but you also have to ensure that new visitors reach your church website.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we go into and list the best church website hosting, you need to know what things you need to consider before making a choice. So, without any delay, let’s get started.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Things to consider</b>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><b>Location:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The web hosting should be able to provide you the server at the location you are targetting. The near it is to the location you are targetting, the better it will perform and ensure that it gets a good amount of traffic.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Price:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As you are running a church, you need to find the best match for your budget. The web hosting that you choose should offer a good value for your money and also provide decent features in return.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Tech Support: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most important aspect of a web hosting that you need to be sure about. Without tech support, you will be stuck with a non-functioning or a broken website.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Support for the platform:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The web hosting should provide you the infrastructure supporting the CMS you are using. For example, if you are using WordPress, then you need to find a WordPress hosting platform.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. </span><b>Control Panel:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always choose a web hosting platform that offers a control panel or a user interface. Most of the web hosting comes with cPanel support. It may also come with Plesk. We suggest you do online research and find which one suits you. For beginners we recommend cPanel.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find a lot of church website hosting out there. Most of them are good, but as a consumer, you should always look for the best. Also, church websites have a unique presence on the internet. As they are religious, the hosting also needs to be unique regarding features and performance. Not only it has to make sure that old visitors are keeping coming, but you also have to ensure that new visitors reach your church website.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we go into and list the best church website hosting, you need to know what things you need to consider before making a choice. So, without any delay, let’s get started.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Things to consider</b>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><b>Location:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The web hosting should be able to provide you the server at the location you are targetting. The near it is to the location you are targetting, the better it will perform and ensure that it gets a good amount of traffic.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Price:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As you are running a church, you need to find the best match for your budget. The web hosting that you choose should offer a good value for your money and also provide decent features in return.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Tech Support: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most important aspect of a web hosting that you need to be sure about. Without tech support, you will be stuck with a non-functioning or a broken website.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Support for the platform:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The web hosting should provide you the infrastructure supporting the CMS you are using. For example, if you are using WordPress, then you need to find a WordPress hosting platform.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. </span><b>Control Panel:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always choose a web hosting platform that offers a control panel or a user interface. Most of the web hosting comes with cPanel support. It may also come with Plesk. We suggest you do online research and find which one suits you. For beginners we recommend cPanel.</span>

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>

Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<h3>Final Words</h3>

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>

Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<h3>Final Words</h3>

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!

Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118829\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-button-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Button Styling Options\" width=\"300\" height=\"720\" />

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.

    [post_content] => There are <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/top-wordpress-themes/\">thousands of WordPress themes</a> out there. But only a few of these remained useful over the years. <strong><a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">Divi theme from Elegant Themes</a></strong> is one of these few themes.

The latest update of Divi comes with unlimited customization options and a brand-new frontend editor. You can use this theme to create any kind of website you want. In today’s post, I am going to take an in-depth look at the theme and discuss all the useful features.

Without further ado, let’s begin!
<h3>All New Frontend Builder</h3>
Divi 3 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-theme-builder/\">brand new frontend builder</a>. This enables you to create your own layouts and check out the actual preview at the same time. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/drag-and-drop-wordpress-theme-builders/\">other page builder solutions</a>, you can do things like click on any text field and edit the text, drag and drop elements to adjust the width, height etc. Thanks to the AJAX-powered interface, the changes will take place immediately.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118836\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-visual-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Visual Editor\" width=\"720\" height=\"336\" />

Adding new content couldn’t be easier. Just hover over the desired location and click the ‘+’ icon. You can choose to create your own column-based layout or pick a layout from the library. For each column, you can choose any of the 40+ content elements <a href=\"http://examplesoftheme.com/divi-wordpress-theme-examples/\">provided by Divi theme</a>.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118830\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-content-elements.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Content Elements\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" />

Besides the usual settings options, each content element is provided with its own design options. You can apply custom text styles, margin, padding, border, background etc. for each element. It is also possible to apply custom CSS.

Each content element could be dragged and dropped to any location inside the layout. It is also possible to delete or make duplicates of the content element.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118832\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-element-styling.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Element Styling\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" />

Revision history is another unique feature of the Divi visual builder. This feature shows a list of your recent changes. You can revert to any of these changes just by clicking on them. There are separate undo and redo buttons as well.
<h3>The Divi Page Builder</h3>
If you are used to creating custom layouts by using a page builder, Divi has got you covered as well. The Divi builder includes most features of the visual builder. You can create standard, full width, specialty sections, or choose a layout from the library.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118834\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-page-builder.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Page Builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" />

For each section, it is possible to choose a column-based layout. And for each column, you can choose any content element. Just like the visual builder, you can apply custom styling to the elements, drag and drop, delete, or make duplicates of them.

When working with the page builder, you can choose the sidebar position, navigation style etc. for the post or page.
<h3>Diverse Theme Options</h3>
Divi comes with a diverse range of customization options. You will find these in the Divi &gt; Theme Options page.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118835\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-theme-options.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Theme Options\" width=\"720\" height=\"762\" />

As you can see, the page is divided into several sections. In the General section, you will find options to upload the logo, favicon, enable fixed navigation, smooth scrolling, back to bottom, show <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/best-wordpress-social-media-plugins/\">social media profiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/wordpress-subscription-plugin/\">Mailchimp and Aweber integration options</a>.

In the Navigation section, you can choose which page(s) should be excluded from the menu, enable dropdown menu, exclude categories, hide empty categories etc.

The Layout section allows you to enable or disable comment on the pages. For the singe posts, you can choose to display the author, date, categories, comments etc.

There is a <a href=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/best/seo-optimized-wordpress-themes/\">dedicated section for SEO</a>. This section enables you to allow the custom title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical URL, separator character etc.

The integration section enables you to add code to the head, body of your website, or at the top or bottom of your posts. There is also a section for managing the ads.
<h3>Unlimited Customization Options</h3>
Along with usual options like site title, menu, widget, and color schemes, Divi theme customizer features lots of other customization options. For instance, you can choose the layout and define the website width, section, and row height set the theme accent color.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118831\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-customization.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Customization Options\" width=\"306\" height=\"767\" />

The dedicated typography options enable you to choose different fonts for the heading and body text. As Divi comes with all the popular fonts, you can easily choose your favorite one. It is also possible to choose the color, size, and spacing for the header, text, and links.

Divi supports several header styles. You can choose the suitable style from the ‘Header Format’ section. You can choose to display the social icons, search icon, phone number, and email address in the header. Regarding the menus, it is possible to choose the menu height, font family, text color, active link color, link background color, dropdown menu animation etc.

Divi also allows you to choose the footer layout. The footer widgets could be customized by defining the header text and link styles. You can personalize the footer menu display options too.

Dedicated button styling options is an interesting feature of Divi. This helps you to choose the default text size, color, background color, border styles, font family, icon styles etc. for the buttons. It is also possible to choose the text, background, and border colors for button hovers.

Divi features a fully responsive design. However, you can take this into a whole new level by defining the section, row height, text size, and menu styles for mobile and tablet devices.
<h3>Other Features of Divi</h3>
Along with the awesome features mentioned above, Divi also includes a few other notable features. First of all, there are 20+ ready-made layouts and demos available for you. You can choose any of these and get your website started within a few minutes.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118833\" src=\"https://www.softwarefindr.com/wp-content/uploads/Divi-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Layouts\" width=\"720\" height=\"728\" />

What’s more, Elegant Themes conducted a 100-day Divi Resources event which featured hundreds of examples of using Divi in different ways. You can download and use any of these layouts for free.

With full RTL support, Divi can be used to create websites in other languages too. As the theme is already translated in 32 different languages, chances are your language is already covered by Divi.

Every website owner is concerned about the security aspect, and I know you are too. Well, Divi has thought about that as well. The complete theme coding is checked by Sucuri and they found zero security issues. That means you can use Divi in all your websites with absolute confidence.
<h3>Divi Pricing</h3>
You have to be an Elegant Themes member to use Divi. There are three pricing plans –
<ul>
 	<li>Priced at $69 per year, the Personal plan provides access to all themes by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at $89 per year, the Developer plan provides access to all themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
 	<li>Priced at a one-time fee of $249, the Lifetime Access plan offers unlimited access to all the themes and plugins by Elegant Themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
Over the years, I have used lots of WordPress themes, including the most popular ones (and some uncommon ones). But none of them were able to impress me as Divi did. And the latest update has made it even more interesting. I highly recommend it for any web development project.

But that’s only my opinion. I am more interested to know your thoughts about Divi. What do you think about its features? Have you used this theme in any of your websites? Let me know by leaving a comment below.
