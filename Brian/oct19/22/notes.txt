First of all, I am sorry for a mistake of mine. I have stopped working on the testing page, it is obsolete.
https://area51.softwarefindr.com/new-one/ This page is used to create a new list item product.
Then, on submit it redirects us to https://area51.softwarefindr.com/update-software/?update-software=147286 to further add information to that product.
